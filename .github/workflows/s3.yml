# We are now able to install, build and test our app before deploying to S3.
# We are using Yarn as it is the default package manager for create-react-app; 
# However, this works exactly the same with NPM and others.
# Running these Yarn scripts will ensure your app builds correctly and passes all unit tests before being pushed to the S3 bucket,

# Finally, we need to add in the deployment step, which is can be done by using a Github Action called s3-sync-action 
# The Action takes your compiled application and sends it to a designated S3 bucket using pre-defined environment variables.
# Using the uses key once again, this is all we need to do to import the Action,
# then using the with key we utilise the relevant arguments that are required when uploading to S3:

# --acl public-read: assuming your S3 bucket is configured to be publicly readable, this will ensure that the uploaded files are too.
# --delete: this deletes any files within the S3 bucket that do not exist in the uploaded files.
